Critical Step: Reinstall Dependencies
Since you’ve changed your Node.js version, it’s a good idea to reinstall your project dependencies to ensure compatibility.

Clear node_modules and package-lock.json:

bash
Copy code
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
Reinstall Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Step 4: Test the Bot
Run your bot again using the downgraded Node.js version:

bash
Copy code
node index.js
Step 5: Monitor and Debug
Observe whether the deprecation warnings and errors persist. This temporary downgrade should help you continue working on your project without interruption while you seek more permanent fixes.

This should allow your bot to function without the deprecation warnings affecting the performance in the short term.
